Our methods tried to see if knowing the experience levels of players could be predictive of longer sessions to investigate which 'kind' of player would likely contribute larger amounts of data. Based on our findings, we believe that players of ____ level tend to play longer amounts, resulting in a larger amount of data collected by the research team. This helps the research team and can impact their recruiting methods as they will be able to allocate their resources in targeting ____ players, such as by _____ or ______. </p>"
