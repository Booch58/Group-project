Our methods tried to see if knowing the experience levels of players could be predictive of longer sessions to investigate which 'kind' of player would likely contribute larger amounts of data. Based on our findings, we believe that players of ____ level tend to play longer amounts, resulting in a larger amount of data collected by the research team. This helps the research team in their reWe would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\n",
