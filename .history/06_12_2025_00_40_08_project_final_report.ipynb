    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Background  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore player behavior on a dedicated Minecraft server, managed by the Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Minecraft offers an open-world environment where players have significant freedom to explore, build, and interact. By analyzing player sessions and characteristics, this study seeks to uncover patterns that can inform server management, recruitment strategies, and resource allocation. The primary goal of this analysis is to determine if player experience levels are predictive of session length, which could help tailor recruitment efforts to specific player profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question  \n",
    "Is the experience level of players predictive of length and time of sessions?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is critical for understanding whether recruitment should target players with specific experience levels (e.g., \"Pro\" or \"Veteran\") or if a broader recruitment strategy is equally effective. By examining the relationship between self-reported experience and session duration, this project intends to provide actionable insights for the PLAI group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The data of interest for this project is a player and session information of gamers using a free Minecraft server hosted and monitored by the Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence at UBC studying player behaviours to develop embodied AI. We have two `.csv` files called `players` and `sessions` with 196 observations and 7 variables, and 1535 observations and 5 variables, respectively. "

    "<p>These results are _____ to what we expected. Before conducting our analysis, we predicted that higher reported experience levels should be predictive of longer session lengths in this dataset. Intuitively, we felt that this would make sense as more experienced players have a higher level of dedication to Minecraft, and would therefore play more hours. </p>\n",

    "### 3. Discussion of impact of findings\n",
    "<p>Our methods tried to see if the start time and end time of gaming sessions could be predictive of the user's experience level. Our exploratory figures regarding start times, particularly figure 3, indicated that Pro users had peak start times of 1300 minutes past 00:00 (21:40), veterans, amateurs, and beginners at 250 minutes past 00:00 (04:10), and regular users at 200 minutes past 00:00 (03:20). Taking this together with our results from figure 1 which displayed mean durations of sessions by experience level, we could initally expect that our results would be suggestive of allocating resources to recruit regular and pro users at 03:20 and 21:40, respectively. However, our analysis results suggested elsewise. Unfortunately, our classification model lacked accuracy with a value of 0.64. This resulted in 0 correct predictions regarding the experience levels pro, veteran, and beginner out of the 39, 51, and 106 users, respectively (figure 2, figure 6). However, the . recruitment effortsThis suggested from thknowing the experience levels of players could be predictive of longer sessions to investigate which 'kind' of player would likely contribute larger amounts of data. Based on our findings, we believe that players of ____ level tend to play longer amounts, resulting in a larger amount of data collected by the research team. This helps the research team and can impact their recruiting methods as they will be able to allocate their resources in targeting ____ players, such as by _____ or ______. </p>\n",
